# 👋 Hi, I’m @PabloBartolomeMolina (Pablo)

## Introduction

I work on the automotive sector, developing C code for embedded projects, following standards like MISRA C and ISO26262. Also, I develop tools for automatization in Python and create AI Agents, to ease the work of the team accross different activities of our daily work.

I also set up AI agents to automatize complex tasks of the daily workflow of the team, including:
- Tests vectors for all possible combinations.
- Ensure full coverage for C0, C1, and MC/DC.
- Cover happy path and edge cases during the Unit Tests.
- Data treatment under specific formats given by the project.
- Reinforce quality levels of Pull Requests.

Outside this professional summary, some relevant data about me:
- 👀 I’m interested in autonomotive, aeronautics and railway sectors. 
- 🌱 I’m keep improving my skills in C++ and Python, while learning how to better use the existing AI tools and create new ones.
- 💞️ I’m looking to **collaborate on public projects, so feel free to contact me!**
- I try to write as much as possible on Linkedin and Medium about technical topics and relevant news.
